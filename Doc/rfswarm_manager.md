## User Interface
### Plan
This is where you construct your test scenario, choose your test cases and number of virtual users. The interface should be intuitive and simple to understand but still allow fairly complex scenarios to be created.

All the time fields (Delay, Ramp Up & Run) are in Seconds, due to the way the [agent polling](./rfswarm_agent.md#agent-polling-of-the-guiserver) works it's best not to use values less than 10 seconds.

While hopefully this is intuitive, the tool bar buttons are:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| New | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_page_white.edt.gif) | Create a new scenario |
| Open | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_folder_explore.gif) | Open an existing scenario |
| Save | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_disk.gif) | Save the current scenario |
| Settings | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_cog.gif) | Configure additional settings for the current scenario or rfswarm |
| Schedule | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_time.gif) | Schedule the test start time |
| Play | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_resultset_next.gif) | Play the current scenario |

The test group buttons are:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| Add | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_add.gif) | Add another test group |
| Select | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_script.gif) | Select a robot file |
| Settings | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_cog.gif) | Configure additional settings for a test group |
| Remove | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_cross.gif) | Remove this test group |


The columns under the graph:

| Column Name | Detail |
|---|---|
| Index | The test group's line number in the scenario, the background colour matches the line colour in the graph above |
| Robots | The number of robots (virtual users) you are planning to run in the scenario for this test group |
| Delay | The amount of time (HH:MM:SS*) to wait before starting Ramp Up |
| Ramp Up | The amount of time (HH:MM:SS*) to get from 0 virtual users (robots) to the number of virtual users (robots) defined in the Users column |
| Run | The amount of time (HH:MM:SS*) to keep all the virtual users (robots) defined in the Users column running after Ramp Up has finished. If a robot finishes it's test steps before the end of this time it will be restarted After this time has elapsed the robots will finish their test steps and exit normally (Ramp Down) |
| Script | This is where you select the robot file that contains the test you want to assign to this test group |
| Test | This is where you select the test you want to run for this test group, this option list is auto populated when you select a robot file in the Script column |
| Settings | This is where you can select additional settings for the test group |

* For Delay, Ramp Up and Run, you can either type the time in HH:MM:SS or just a number of seconds or MM:SS, the plan screen will auto update it to HH:MM:SS. For example if you typed 300 it will update to 00:05:00, 7200 will update to 02:00:00, also if you type 5:30 it will update to 00:05:30.

#### Settings for the scenario and rfswarm ![image](Images/GUI_btn_cog.gif)
> ![image](Images/Linux_Plan_v1.4.0_Settings.png)

##### Scenario settings
At the moment there is only one scenario setting, the upload logs setting, this allows you to control when the agent will upload the logs for the test cases being run.
> ![image](Images/Linux_Plan_v1.3.0_Settings_UploadLogs.png)

The options are:
| Option | Action |
|---|---|
| Immediately | As soon as a test case finishes it will start uploading the logs regardless of test result in parallel to starting the next iteration of that test case |
| On Error Only (default)| As soon as a test case finishes it will start uploading the logs only if the test ended with a fail, result logs for passed tests will be deferred until the last robot has stopped on the agent |
| All Deferred | All test result logs will be deferred until the last robot has stopped on the agent |

\* In earlier releases before v1.0.0 the agent always followed the default case.
##### Test Defaults settings
The test defaults settings allow you to set default default setting values for all test groups. These settings allow you to change and define what the default values are but can still be overridden for an individual test group in the [Additional settings for test group](./rfswarm_manager.md#additional-settings-for-test-group-) screen
> ![image](Images/Linux_Plan_v1.4.0_Settings.png)

###### Result Name Mode
By configuring this setting you can adjust response times named in the test results. The Options are:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Default | This option is the default behaviour, it also retains the behaviour of RFSwarm versions prior to 1.4.0. This option is a combination if Information and Documentation, first the keyword is checked for an Information message that is not a Trace or return data message if found the Information message is used as the result name, next if no Information message is found the keyword's  Documentation is checked, if found the Documentation is used as the result name, if neither an Information message or Documentation is found no result is returned |
| Documentation | This option uses only the keyword Documentation, if the keyword does not have any Documentation no result is returned |
| Information | This option checks for an Information message that is not a Trace or return data message if found the Information message is used as the result name, otherwise no result is returned. User keywords in robot framework cannot return Information messages, only python keywords or Library keyword can be used with this option |
| Keyword | This option uses the Keyword name for the result name, as such with this option any keyword that's not part of an excluded library will return a result |
| Keyword & Arguments | This option uses the Keyword combined with any arguments passed to the Keyword as the result name, as such with this option any keyword that's not part of an excluded library will return a result |

> ![image](Images/Linux_Plan_v1.4.0_Settings_ResultNameMode.png)

###### Exclude libraries
The default value is "BuiltIn,String,OperatingSystem,perftest", this is the same default value as used in the [agent settings](./rfswarm_agent.md#exclude-libraries) and if you leave this default but change the agent the settings set on the agent will override this setting.
By configuring this setting you can adjust which keyword's response times are reported in the test results.
If you change this setting here from the default, then the agent setting will be overridden with the settings used here for all test groups.

| agent ini setting | scenario setting | test group setting | result |
|---|---|---|---|
| default | default | default | default (BuiltIn,String,OperatingSystem,perftest) |
| configured | default | default | agent ini setting |
| default | configured | default | scenario setting |
| default | default | configured | test group setting |
| default | configured | configured | test group setting |
| configured | configured | default | scenario setting |
| configured | configured | configured | test group setting |

###### Robot Options
By default this setting is blank and in most cases wouldn't be used, it allows you to pass additional command-line options to the robot executable, to find out what options can be passed run
`robot -h`
On any machine that has Robot Framework installed

###### Test Repeater
This setting when enabled will cause Robot Framework to repeat the selected test case in the same test suite continually until either a the test fails or the scenario ends.

This gives the ability to use the Suite Startup for steps such as open browser or app login, before running the test, have the test run many times with the same login or browser window, and then call logout or close browser at the end of the test suite

By default this setting is disabled, retaining the behaviour from RFSwarm versions prior to v1.2.0, where the test case executed only once in the test suite, the suite ended and the robot exited and a new robot was started every iteration.

Enabling this setting here will enable it for all test groups

###### Inject Sleep
This setting when enabled will add the Sleep keyword after each timed keyword, the amount of sleep time added in seconds will be randomly chosen between the minimum and maximum values.

If you want the amount of sleep time to always be the same, set the minimum and maximum values to the same value.

Enabling this setting here will enable it for all test groups

###### Disable Robot Logs
These settings when enabled will disable the generation of the selected files on the agent machine by instructing robot framework not to generate these files.

If you disable output.xml but leave either log.html or report.html enabled then output.xml will still get created as it's required for generating the
HTML files. This behaviour is controlled by robot framework not RFSwarm.

Enabling these settings here will enable it for all test groups

##### Manager settings
The manager settings allows you to access settings that were previously only accessible from the ini file
> ![image](Images/Linux_Plan_v1.4.0_Settings.png)

###### Bind IP Address

This setting allows you to restrict the web server that the manager uses to communicate with the agents to a specific ip address. By default this setting is blank so the manager will listen on all IP addresses on the machine the manager is running on.
Generally you should not need to change this setting and it should be left blank unless you know you need to restrict the manager to a specific address.

\* You will need to restart the manager for this setting to take effect.

###### Bind Port Number

The default port that the manager web server uses to communicate with the agents is 8138, however in some cases you may need to change the port number.

\* You will need to restart the manager for this setting to take effect.

###### Results Location

This setting allows you to configure where the manager will save the test results when you run a performance test.


#### Schedule start time ![image](Images/GUI_btn_time.gif)
This feature allows you to schedule the start time for a test, by default it is disabled and if you press the run button the test will start immediately.
> ![image](Images/MacOS_Run_v1.0.0_Schedule_disabled.png)

If you enable this setting you can set the time that the test will start, the start time must always be in the future, by default it will be on the same day, but if you enter a time in the past, it will automatically adjust to the next day.
> ![image](Images/MacOS_Run_v1.0.0_Schedule_enabled.png)

e.g. 1 - if the time now is 11:30 PM and you want your test to start at 1 AM the next day, enter a time of 01:00:00 and tomorrows date will show in the scheduled start date

e.g. 2 - if the time now is 9:05 PM and you planned to start at 9:00 AM, so enter a time of 09:00:00 without realising that was already in the past, the test will not start till 9 AM tomorrow. In this case choose a new start time later today or disable the schedule and just click run.

\* The manager needs to remain running in order for the schedule to work. You cannot schedule a start time and then quit the manager.

#### Additional settings for test group ![image](Images/GUI_btn_cog.gif)

When clicking on this button a dialogue will be presented that allows you to configure some additional settings for the test group, by default the dialogue will look like this:
> ![image](Images/Linux_Plan_v1.4.0_Test_Settings.png)

##### Result Name Mode - Test Group
This setting allows you to adjust how response times are named in the test results. This has the same default and option values as [Result Name Mode](./rfswarm_manager.md#result-name-mode) in Test Defaults Settings, however here you can override the default settings for this particular test group.

> ![image](Images/Linux_Plan_v1.4.0_Test_Settings_ResultNameMode.png)

##### Exclude libraries - Test Group
The default value is "BuiltIn,String,OperatingSystem,perftest", this is the same default value as used in the [agent settings](./rfswarm_agent.md#exclude-libraries) and if you leave this default but change the agent the settings set on the agent will override this setting.
By configuring this setting you can adjust which keyword's response times are reported in the test results.
If you change this setting here from the default, then for this particular test group the agent setting will be overridden with the settings used here

##### Robot Options - Test Group
By default this setting is blank and in most cases wouldn't be used, it allows you to pass additional command-line options to the robot executable, to find out what options can be passed run
`robot -h`
On any machine that has Robot Framework installed

##### Test Repeater - Test Group
This setting when enabled will cause Robot Framework to repeat the selected test case in the same test suite continually until either a the test fails or the scenario ends.

This gives the ability to use the Suite Startup for steps such as open browser or app login, before running the test, have the test run many times with the same login or browser window, and then call logout or close browser at the end of the test suite

By default this setting is disabled, retaining the behaviour from RFSwarm versions prior to v1.2.0, where the test case executed only once in the test suite, the suite ended and the robot exited and a new robot was started every iteration.

Enabling/disabling this setting here will enable it for this test group

###### Inject Sleep - Test Group
This setting when enabled will add the Sleep keyword after each timed keyword, the amount of sleep time added in seconds will be randomly chosen between the minimum and maximum values.

If you want the amount of sleep time to always be the same, set the minimum and maximum values to the same value.

Enabling/disabling this setting here will enable it for this test group

###### Disable Robot Logs - Test Group
These settings when enabled will disable the generation of the selected files on the agent machine by instructing robot framework not to generate these files.

If you disable output.xml but leave either log.html or report.html enabled then output.xml will still get created as it's required for generating the
HTML files. This behaviour is controlled by robot framework not RFSwarm.

Enabling/disabling these settings here will enable it for this test group

##### Agent Filter
You can use this setting to modify the default [agent assignment](#agent-assignment) to require test cases to require agents with particular properties or to exclude agents with particular properties.

By default there are no Agent filters applied, and the test group can be run on any available agent.

Here are some examples of when you might need this setting:
- Your AUT has a desktop client and a web ui, the tests executed in the desktop client need an agent with Windows os and the web ui scripts can run on any agent that has SeleniumLibrary available
  - on the desktop client scripts you add a filter rule that Requires "OS: System: windows"
  - on the web ui scripts you add a filter rule that Requires "RobotFramework: Library: seleniumlibrary"
- Your AUT has an internal component that can only be accessed by users in your corporate network and an external component that can only be accessed by internet users
  - in your agents ini file you configure a custom property of "Corp Network" or "Internet" depending on which network the agent sits in.
  - on the internal component scripts you add a filter rule that Requires "Corp Network"
  - on the external component scripts you add a filter rule that Requires "Internet" alternatively you could configure a rule that Excludes "Corp Network"

The combination of multiple require and exclude rules, the default and custom agent properties should allow you to have the control needed to target your test groups to specific agent or groups of agents as needed.

Here is an example of configuring the Filter Rules and using the Robot options:
> ![image](Images/Linux_Plan_v1.3.0_Test_Settings_Filter_Rules.png)

### Monitoring
This section allows you to add monitoring tests/tasks separately from the tests used for the Application Under Test (AUT), to make a clear distinction between tests that are for validating the performance of the AUT and tests/tasks used for monitoring

- All monitoring groups will have:
  - 1 robot each
  - a delay and ramp-up of 0 seconds
  - and for run, the time is calculated based on `Monitoring time before test + total plan execution time + Monitoring time after test`
- All monitoring groups will start immediately and run until the scenario end

#### Monitoring time before test
when this field is set to a value greater than 0, it will delay all test groups on the plan tab by this amount of time, this delay is in addition to any delay set on a test group. During this time only the monitoring groups will run.

#### Monitoring time after test
when this field is set to a value greater than 0, it will keep the monitoring groups will running for this amount of time after the test finishes and the number of running robots has reached 0 robots. During this time only the monitoring groups will continue running.

While hopefully this is intuitive, the tool bar buttons are:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| New | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_page_white.edt.gif) | Create a new scenario |
| Open | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_folder_explore.gif) | Open an existing scenario |
| Save | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_disk.gif) | Save the current scenario |
| Settings | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_cog.gif) | Configure additional settings for the current scenario or rfswarm |
| Schedule | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_time.gif) | Schedule the test start time |
| Play | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_resultset_next.gif) | Play the current scenario |

The monitoring group buttons are:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| Add | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_add.gif) | Add another monitoring group |
| Select | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_script.gif) | Select a robot file |
| Settings | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_cog.gif) | Configure additional settings for a monitoring group |
| Remove | ![image](Images/GUI_btn_cross.gif) | Remove this monitoring group |

The columns in the monitoring group are:

| Column Name | Detail |
|---|---|
| Index | The test group's line number in the scenario |
| Script | This is where you select the robot file that contains the test you want to assign to this monitoring group |
| Test | This is where you select the test/task you want to run for this monitoring group, this option list is auto populated when you select a robot file in the Script column |
| Settings | This is where you can select additional settings for the monitoring group |

### Run
This is where you monitor your test scenario as it runs, here you will see number of robots running, how long the has been running and live updates of the test results.

Unique by checkboxes:
- Index, use this if multiple test cases have results with the same result name but you want to keep the result timings separated based on the individual test cases.
- Iteration, use this if you want to keep the result timings separated based on the test iteration.
- Sequence, use this if multiple test steps in the same test case have the same result name but you want to keep the result timings separated based on the sequence within the test case.

%ile (Percentile) field:
The default value is 90, you can adjust the percentile value between 1% and 99% depending on your application's performance requirements.

#### Stop button ![image](Images/GUI_btn_stop.gif)
Use this if you want to stop the test early. You may not notice an immediate reaction as pressing the button just changes the end time on all the test jobs assigned to the current time and stops the ramp-up if the test is still in the ramp-up phase.

Once the stop button has been pressed the agents will receive the changed end time when they [poll](./rfswarm_agent.md#agent-polling-of-the-guiserver) the Manager next, the agent will change status to stopping which will be returned on the next poll interval and the agent will not start a new iteration for the running tests, however the ones currently running will be allowed to complete.

#### Abort button ![image](Images/GUI_btn_bomb.gif)
This button replaces the Stop button when either of the following happens:
- You press the Stop button
- The test reaches the ramp-down period after run is complete

Clicking the Abort button will present a warning dialogue like this:
![image](Images/MacOS_Run_v0.8.0_Abort_Dialogue.png)
Clicking yes on this dialogue will instruct the agents to send a sigterm (^C) to the running robots causing them to abort the currently running test and execute any teardown steps then exit.
You would normally only use this option if your AUT has crashed and you need to stop applying load to the system.

#### Disabled Stop button ![image](Images/GUI_btn_stop_grey.gif)
This button replaces the Stop/Abort buttons when either of the following happens
- You clicked yes to abort the run
- The test completes ramp-down
Clicking this button does nothing.

#### CSV Report button ![image](Images/GUI_btn_report.gif)
Use this to generate csv files suitable for use to create reports for your test run, there will be three files generated:
- A Summary file, this is the same data as on the run screen
- A Raw Results file, the is every data point recorded, useful if you want create response time graphs
- An Agents file, this is all the agent stats recorded, useful if you want to graph running robots or agent loads

> ![Image](Images/Linux-v0.5.0_Run_Report_prompt.png)


The columns for the run screen:

| Column Name | Detail |
|---|---|
| _Index_ | _This optional column indicates the test groups the result came from and matches the test group index from the plan screen_ |
| _Iteration_ | _This optional column indicates iteration the result came from, the first time a robot runs a test on an agent is iteration 1, the next time that same robot runs that test is iteration 2, etc. e.g. in a 1hr test with 50 robots in a test group robot 1 (first robot started in test group)may run 12 iterations but robot 50 (last robot started in test group) may only run 10 iterations of the same test before the end of the run period of the scenario_ |
| _Sequence_ | _This optional column indicates sequence number (autogenerated number) of the test step within the test case_ |
| Result Name | This is the result name as reported by robot framework, usually this will match either the documentation or full name lines for a test step in a robot framework report |
| Min | This is the shortest (quickest) response time reported by any robot during the test |
| Avg | This is the average of all the response time reported by all robots during the test |
| nn%ile | This is the percentile as configured by the %ile field above the run results. e.g. 90%ile is the response time that 90% of robots reported a response time less than or equal to during the test |
| Max | This is the longest (slowest) response time reported by any robot during the test |
| Stdev | This is the [Standard Deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of the response times for this result |
| Pass | This is a count of the number of times a robot reported a pass for this test step |
| Fail | This is a count of the number of times a robot reported a fail for this test step |
| Other | This is a count of the number of times a robot reported a result other than pass or fail for this result (normally this would be 0) |

The columns in the CSV report match the columns from the run screen at the time the report is generated, so when comparing results from tests using the same scenario you need to be careful that the optional column selection is the same.

_Note: generally the optional columns are not required, but they are available if they are useful to you._

### Agents
This is where you can see which agents have connected, number of robots on each agent and monitor the status and performance of the agents.
> _Agents - Ready_ <br>
> ![Image](Images/MacOS_Agents_v0.8.0_Ready.png "Agents - Ready")

>
> _Agents - Running (Linux)_ <br>
> ![Image](Images/Linux-v0.5.0_Agents_Running.png)

The columns for the agents screen:

| Column Name | Detail |
|---|---|
| Status | This is the last status reported by the agent, unless a agent hasn't reported for a while, then this will show "Offline?". If the agent load is over 80% then status will be "Warning", and over 95% "Critical". All other status values are reported by the agent. |
| Agent | This is the agent's name as reported by the agent, usually this is the agent's hostname but this can be configured on the agent |
| Last Seen | This is the time the last status update was received from the agent |
| Assigned | This is the number of robots assigned to the agent during ramp up |
| Robots | This is the number of robots that the agent reported as actually running at the last status update |
| Load | This is the load value used by rfswarm to assign new robots to the agent with the lowest load, this value is the highest value of % CPU, % MEM and % NET |
| % CPU | This is the current percentage of CPU usage as reported by the agents operating system |
| % MEM | This is the current percentage of memory usage as reported by the agents operating system |
| % NET | This is the current percentage of network usage as reported by the agents operating system |
| Version | This is the rfswarm version number of the rfswarm agent |
| Libraries | This is a list of robot framework libraries installed on the agent machine as reported by the python runtime that is running the agent (only python libraries that start with "robotframework-" are reported here |


### About
This is where you can see the rfswarm manager version and links to the documentation as well as the donation links.

> _About_ <br>
> ![Image](Images/MacOS_About_v0.8.0_About.png "About")


Clicking the links (blue text) will open the page in the default browser on you computer.


### Graphs
New with version 0.8.0 is the ability to have live graphs during the test run displaying various data about the test.

You can access the graphs through the new Graphs menu
> _Graphs - Menu_ <br>
> ![Image](Images/MacOS_Graphs_v0.8.0_Menu.png "Graphs - Menu")
>
> _Graphs - Examples Menu_ <br>
> ![Image](Images/MacOS_Graphs_v0.8.0_Menu_Examples.png "Graphs - Examples Menu")


The Graphs menu has the following options:

| Menu Option | Detail |
|---|---|
| New Graph Window | This option opens a new un-configured graph window with the settings showing so you can configure as you need, you can also use the shortcut key top open a new graph. |
| Examples | Inside this menu is a list of preconfigured graphs, these will open with the settings closed as they are ready to use |
| Recent | This menu is dynamically generated, it contains all the graphs that have been recently opened on this computer, if you select a graph from this menu that is already open then it will be brought to the front and gain focus, otherwise it will open the graph as it was when it was closed |
| Scenario | This menu is dynamically generated, it contains all the graphs that were opened when the scenario was saved, if you select a graph from this menu that is already open then it will be brought to the front and gain focus, otherwise it will open the graph as it was when it was closed. If you save preconfigured graphs on one machine and then open the scenario on another machine these graphs will automatically open when you open the scenario and attempt to retain their position. |

## Command-line Interface

These command-line options allow you to override the ini file configuration but do not update the ini file.

Additionally the debug (-g) levels 1-3 will give extra information on the console useful for troubleshooting your environment. debug levels above 5 are more for debugging the code and get very noisy so are not recommended for normal use.

```console
$ rfswarm -h
Robot Framework Swarm: Manager
	Version 1.0.0
usage: rfswarm.py [-h] [-g DEBUG] [-v] [-i INI] [-s SCENARIO] [-r] [-a AGENTS] [-n] [-t STARTTIME] [-d DIR] [-e IPADDRESS] [-p PORT]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -g DEBUG, --debug DEBUG
                        Set debug level, default level is 0
  -v, --version         Display the version and exit
  -i INI, --ini INI     path to alternate ini file
  -s SCENARIO, --scenario SCENARIO
                        Load this scenario file
  -r, --run             Run the scenario automatically after loading
  -a AGENTS, --agents AGENTS
                        Wait for this many agents before starting (default 1)
  -n, --nogui           Don't display the GUI
  -t STARTTIME, --starttime STARTTIME
                        Specify the time to start the test HH:MM or HH:MM:SS (ISO 8601)
  -d DIR, --dir DIR     Results directory
  -e IPADDRESS, --ipaddress IPADDRESS
                        IP Address to bind the server to
  -p PORT, --port PORT  Port number to bind the server to
```

If you pass in an unsupported command-line option, you will get this prompt:
```console
$ rfswarm -?
Robot Framework Swarm: Manager
	Version 1.0.0
usage: rfswarm.py [-h] [-g DEBUG] [-v] [-i INI] [-s SCENARIO] [-r] [-a AGENTS] [-n] [-t STARTTIME] [-d DIR] [-e IPADDRESS] [-p PORT]
rfswarm: error: unrecognized arguments: -?
```

## Install and Setup

### 1. Install
#### 1.1 Prerequisites
- The Manager machine needs to use a minimum of Python 3.7
> ThreadingHTTPServer feature of HTTPServer requires was added in Python 3.7

- tkinter may need to be installed, or it may already installed on your system, if it's not installed consult the [python documentation](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html) on how to install for your system.

On Debian based systems this will probably work
```console
apt install python3-tk
```

#### 1.2 Install

Once you have the prerequisites sorted, the installation is simply
```console
pip* install rfswarm-manager
```
\*some systems might need you to use pip3 and or sudo

Next, desktop users can optionally install the desktop icon
- In the start menu for Windows
- In the Applications folder for Mac
- As a .desktop file for Linux (known to work for Gnome, KDE, Cinamon, XFCE, LXQt, should also work for other desktop environments that support standard .desktop files)

Using the command
```console
rfswarm-manager -c icon
```

### 2. Adjust the Firewall

Check if there is a firewall on you Manager machine, if so you may need to adjust the firewall to add a rule to allow communication between the Manager and the Agent.

| Machine | Protocol | Port Number<sup>1</sup> | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Manager | TCP | 8138 | Inbound |
| Agent | TCP | 8138 | Outbound |

<sup>1</sup> This is the default port number, replace with the port number you used if you changed it in the ini file or used the -p command-line switch.

Most firewalls on servers and workstations don't require specific rules for outbound, so most likely you will only need to configure the Inbound rule on the Manager machine if it has a firewall.


### 3. Run the Manager

```console
rfswarm
```

### 4. Manual Install the prerequisites

- The Manager machine needs to use a minimum of Python 3.7
> ThreadingHTTPServer feature of HTTPServer requires was added in Python 3.7

- tkinter may need to be installed, or it may already installed on your system, if it's not installed consult the [python documentation](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html) on how to install for your system.

On Debian based systems this will probably work
```python
apt install python3-tk python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk
```

Additionally the following pip command might be needed if these are not already installed on your system:
```console
pip* install configparser setuptools hashlib HTTPServer pillow matplotlib
```
> setuptools (is required by hashlib and HTTPServer)

\*some systems might need you to use pip3 and or sudo

### 5. Manual Run the Manager

Use this method if you did not install using pip

```console
python* rfswarm.py
```
\*or python3 on some systems


## Agent Assignment

As a result of experience with other load testing tools and difficulties in managing load generation machines, the agent assignment algorithm in rfswarm has been designed to switch modes to cater for several scenarios but not require manual intervention

The scenarios rfswarm has been designed to cater for:

1. Need to ensure each agent gets only 1 virtual user each
2. When there is a low number of virtual user, you want them distributed evenly across all the agents
3. When the agent machines are a variety of hardware (newer and older machines) you don't want the virtual user distributed evenly across all the agents, but rather you want the more powerful agents to take a larger share of the virtual users to avoid any agent getting overloaded.
4. Sometimes you need to apply a custom filter to Require/Exclude a test group to run on specific agents or groups of agents.

How the assignment algorithm works:
- As the scenario is ready to start the next virtual user the Manager calls the assignment algorithm
- First the agents are checked against the Agent Filter rules for the test group that is requiring an agent to be assigned, if the agent passes all the filter rules it is added to the list to be sorted.
- Next the assignment algorithm sorts the agents list by the number of virtual users assigned to each agent
- The agent with the lowest number of assigned virtual users is selected, there may be several agents with the equal lowest number of virtual users, e.g. at the start of the test all agents equally have zero (0) virtual users assigned, then the first agent from the list with this assigned count is selected.
- Before returning the selected agent the assigned virtual user count is checked to see if it is greater than 10, if not the selected agent is returned from the assignment algorithm.
- If the selected agent's assigned virtual user count is greater than 10, the selection is discarded and the assignment algorithm returns to the filtered agent list.
  - this time the agent list is sorted by the agent loads (See Load column in the screenshot of the agents tab above), where the load is simply the highest of the 3 monitored percentages (% CPU Usage, % Memory Consumption, % Network bandwidth usage)
  - the machine with the lowest load is selected and returned from the assignment algorithm.
