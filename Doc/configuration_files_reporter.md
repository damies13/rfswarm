# Configuration files for Reporter
[Return to Index](README.md)

1. [Configuration File](#configuration-file)
1. [Template File](#template-file)

## Configuration File
The configuration File is the default configuration file format for the Reporter and is created when the Reporter is launched for the first time or when the Reporter cannot find it in the default directory.

**Example default RFSwarmReporter.ini file:**
```ini
[GUI]
win_width = 800
win_height = 370
donation_reminder = 1746894451

[Reporter]
resultdir = C:\rfswarm\venv\Lib\site-packages\rfswarm_manager\results
results = C:\rfswarm\venv\Lib\site-packages\rfswarm_manager\results\20250501_103943_browser\20250501_103943_browser.db
report = C:\rfswarm\venv\Lib\site-packages\rfswarm_manager\results\20250501_103943_browser\20250501_103943_browser.report
template = C:\rfswarm\templates\browser_template_1.template
templatedir = C:\rfswarm\templates
```

### [GUI]
All of the settings that are related to user interface are under the GUI section heading.

#### Window Width
The window width setting defines the width of the main Reporter window. This setting is mainly used to reopen the Reporter window in the state in which it was closed, you can use this setting to control width manually.
```ini
win_width = 800
```

#### Window Height
The window height setting defines the height of the main Reporter window. This setting is mainly used to reopen the Reporter window in the state in which it was closed, you can use this setting to control height manually.
```ini
win_height = 350
```

#### Donation Reminder
This setting is only used by the Reporter to control donation reminders.
```ini
donation_reminder = 1746482031
```

### [Reporter]
All general settings for Reporter can be found under the Reporter section heading.

#### Result Directory
This setting defines the path to the results directory that will be displayed when selecting them.
```ini
resultdir = C:\rfswarm\venv\Lib\site-packages\rfswarm_manager\results
```

#### Results
The result setting specifies the path to the database file of the results obtained from the manager. From this file the Reporter will gather all the data that manager has collected during the test run so it can create report file.
The data that is used to generate report is also collected from the "Logs" directory, which should be in the same directory as the database file. Additional data includes, for example, screenshots of failed robot tests.
```ini
results = C:\rfswarm\venv\Lib\site-packages\rfswarm_manager\results\20250501_103943_browser\20250501_103943_browser.db
```

#### Report
The report setting indicates the path to the report template file, which is the basis for all possible reports the user may create, for example: HTML report.
This file is just used by Reporter to generate reports and should not be edited. This file is generated based on the provided template file.
```ini
report = C:\rfswarm\venv\Lib\site-packages\rfswarm_manager\results\20250501_103943_browser\20250501_103943_browser.report
```

#### Template
The template setting indicates the path to the template file that defines the appearance and content of the report files generated by Reporter.
```ini
template = C:\rfswarm\venv\Lib\site-packages\rfswarm_reporter\templates\browser_test.template
```

#### Template Directory
This setting defines the default path for template file which will be shown when saving or opening template.
```ini
templatedir = C:\rfswarm\venv\Lib\site-packages\rfswarm_reporter\templates
```

## Template File
This file contains all the configuration that was done in the Reporter and provides the possibility to save created configuration. Once opened, Reporter will load the selected template file into the application.
In this file, you can select section types between: Header, Note, Content, Data Table, Data Graph, Error Details to create a rich report of the run that was completed using the Manager.
